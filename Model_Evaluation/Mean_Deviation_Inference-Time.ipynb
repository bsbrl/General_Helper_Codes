Each file is expected to contain 50 rows of data with two columns: an index and\n","the inference time in seconds. The script searches for files containing \"_it_\" in their filenames, calculates the\n","mean inference time across all entries in each file, and computes the standard deviation. Results are reported\n","in the format \"xx+-yy ms\", where \"xx\" is the mean inference time and \"yy\" is the standard deviation, both in\n","milliseconds.\n","\n","### Usage:\n","- Ensure Python 3.x and pandas are installed on your system.\n","- Place the .csv files in a designated folder.\n","- Update the 'folder_path' variable in the script to the path of your folder containing the .csv files.\n","- Run the script using a Python interpreter: `python mean_inference_time_calculator.py`\n","- The script will print the mean inference time with deviation for each processed file to the console.\n","\n","### Requirements:\n","Python 3.x\n","pandas library (Install using `pip install pandas` if not already installed)\n","\n","### Author:\n","Ibrahim Oladepo\n","\n","### Acknowledgments:\n","The development of this script and its documentation was assisted by ChatGPT.\n","\n","### License:\n","MIT License"],"metadata":{"id":"COw7MThd5itQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Import Necessary Libraries"],"metadata":{"id":"Hi8Oyxfd5lpb"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","import glob\n","import os"],"metadata":{"id":"fh9opPPg5lOX"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Define File Paths and Format"],"metadata":{"id":"D0yRxWaSwylB"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["%cd ..\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"z1UcZ8_EwyB8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708487255071,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":17706,"user":{"displayName":"Ibrahim Oladepo","userId":"15883826471762510546"}},"outputId":"39a8d7cd-ecfd-46a5-b9a2-4458a883a104"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["/\n","Mounted at /content/gdrive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Creates a symbolic link for the model comparison folder\n","!ln -s /content/gdrive/Othercomputers/My\\ PC/PhD_UOM/General/BSBRL/Projects/Motorized_Commutator/Paper/Model_Comparison/Data /Data"],"metadata":{"id":"BnA7EUbmw-c_"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!ls /Data"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"4FfDkTJxxB0T","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1708487257645,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":2392,"user":{"displayName":"Ibrahim Oladepo","userId":"15883826471762510546"}},"outputId":"1caf6a1a-4601-4b6f-d08d-0a52764603bd"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Data\t\t\t\t\t      EVAL_DLC_RESNET-BM_params_2024-02-18.csv\n","EVAL_DLC_MOBILENET-APA_htcm_2024-02-18.csv    EVAL_DLC_RESNET-OF_htcm_2024-02-18.csv\n","EVAL_DLC_MOBILENET-APA_it_2024-02-18.csv      EVAL_DLC_RESNET-OF_it_2024-02-18.csv\n","EVAL_DLC_MOBILENET-APA_params_2024-02-18.csv  EVAL_DLC_RESNET-OF_params_2024-02-18.csv\n","EVAL_DLC_MOBILENET-BM_htcm_2024-02-18.csv     EVAL_SLEAP-APA_htcm_2024-02-18.csv\n","EVAL_DLC_MOBILENET-BM_it_2024-02-18.csv       EVAL_SLEAP-APA_it_2024-02-18.csv\n","EVAL_DLC_MOBILENET-BM_params_2024-02-18.csv   EVAL_SLEAP-APA_params_2024-02-18.csv\n","EVAL_DLC_MOBILENET-OF_htcm_2024-02-18.csv     EVAL_SLEAP-BM_htcm_2024-02-18.csv\n","EVAL_DLC_MOBILENET-OF_it_2024-02-18.csv       EVAL_SLEAP-BM_it_2024-02-18.csv\n","EVAL_DLC_MOBILENET-OF_params_2024-02-18.csv   EVAL_SLEAP-BM_params_2024-02-18.csv\n","EVAL_DLC_RESNET-APA_htcm_2024-02-18.csv       EVAL_SLEAP-OF_htcm_2024-02-18.csv\n","EVAL_DLC_RESNET-APA_it_2024-02-18.csv\t      EVAL_SLEAP-OF_it_2024-02-18.csv\n","EVAL_DLC_RESNET-APA_params_2024-02-18.csv     EVAL_SLEAP-OF_params_2024-02-18.csv\n","EVAL_DLC_RESNET-BM_htcm_2024-02-18.csv\t      Plots\n","EVAL_DLC_RESNET-BM_it_2024-02-18.csv\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Define the folder path containing the .csv files\n","folder_path = \"/Data\"\n","\n","# Pattern to match files containing \"_it_\" in their filenames\n","pattern = os.path.join(folder_path, \"*_it_*.csv\")"],"metadata":{"id":"_Stdp_aS5u69"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Run Calculations"],"metadata":{"id":"O69er9ja52ix"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Iterate through each file matching the pattern\n","for file_path in glob.glob(pattern):\n","    # Load the CSV file\n","    data = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n","\n","    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the inference time (convert seconds to milliseconds)\n","    mean_time_ms = data.iloc[:, 1].mean() * 1000\n","    std_dev_ms = data.iloc[:, 1].std() * 1000\n","\n","    # Format the result as \"xx+-yy ms\"\n","    result = f\"{mean_time_ms:.2f}+-{std_dev_ms:.2f} ms\"\n","\n","    # Print the results for each file\n","    print(f\"Mean inference time for {os.path.basename(file_path)}: {result}\")"],"metadata":{"id":"JWEpYXkm54Tn"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
